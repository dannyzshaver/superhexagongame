# Super Hexagon Inspired Game

## What is it?

Super Hexagon is a fast-paced, minimalist action video game developed by Terry Cavanagh.
It was released in 2012 and is known for its challenging gameplay and geometric visuals.
In the game, players control a small triangle as they navigate through a constantly changing
maze of hexagonal shapes, trying to avoid incoming obstacles. The goal is to survive as long as
possible and achieve a high score.

This remake has the same core gameplay mechanics.

## How do I play?

The player, controlled by the left and right arrow keys, or the left and right mouse buttons,
rotates around the center hexagon, dodging the maze-like obstacles coming in from all sides.
he goal is to survive as long as possible.

## Gameplay
### Below is gameplay from the beginning of the game, where the obstacles move slowly:

### As the game progresses, it becomes faster and more difficult:

## How does it work?
My game takes advantage of one of Northwestern University's basic student game engines,
located in the .cs211 folder. All of the code is commented and explained, and I would read
player.hxx to gain some insight on how the game is programmed at a fundamental level.
